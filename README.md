# CATMAN-GAME

Overview :

Catman is a game that includes a cat running through a maze to eat mice while being followed by a dog. The player will need to collect an amount of mice within a given time without getting caught by the angry dog. This game ressembles the good old fashioned PACMAN game. It is challenging, fun and creative !
